# ✅ Reverted to Stable Version - No Supabase

## What Was Done:
1. ✅ **Removed Supabase dependency** - Uninstalled `@supabase/supabase-js`
2. ✅ **Deleted all Supabase files** - Removed lib/, config/, and documentation files
3. ✅ **Reverted dashboard** - Back to localStorage-based CRUD operations
4. ✅ **Cleaned up** - Removed all Supabase-related documentation
5. ✅ **Tested** - Application runs without errors

## Current Features:
- ✅ **Professional Dashboard UI** - Clean, modern design
- ✅ **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete API keys
- ✅ **localStorage Persistence** - Data saved in browser
- ✅ **Modal Forms** - Professional create/edit forms
- ✅ **Key Management** - View, copy, edit, revoke, delete keys
- ✅ **Usage Tracking** - Monitor API usage per key
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes

## How It Works:
- **Data Storage**: Uses browser localStorage (no external database needed)
- **Sample Data**: Pre-populated with 4 example API keys
- **Full Functionality**: All CRUD operations work perfectly
- **Professional UI**: Matches modern dashboard standards

## Ready to Use:
The application is now stable and ready for development/testing. All Supabase complexity has been removed, and you have a fully functional API key management dashboard that works entirely in the browser.
